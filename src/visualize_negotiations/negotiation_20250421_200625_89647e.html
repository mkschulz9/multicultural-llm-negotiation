**Official Negotiation Statement:**

AéroTech France S.A. is pleased to initiate discussions for the acquisition of AgriTech Brasil Sistemas S.A. We propose the following terms to structure this transaction:

1. **Valuation:**  
   AéroTech France S.A. proposes a valuation of $120 million for AgriTech Brasil Sistemas S.A., representing 1.5 times the target's annual revenues at the upper end of its range. This reflects the company's strong R&D focus and growth potential in precision agriculture technologies.
