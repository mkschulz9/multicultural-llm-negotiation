Key synergies include integrating Verde Madera's innovative eco-friendly practices and expanding our market presence in Brazil. Potential friction points, such as cultural integration, will be addressed through collaborative communication and mutual respect.

We plan an 8-week due diligence period to review operational, financial, and environmental practices. A signing date is proposed for 10 weeks from now, with a 20% earn-out based on EBITDA growth over three years post-acquisition.

We suggest modifying the payment structure to 80% cash and 20% stock. This change ensures immediate value for our shareholders while maintaining alignment with long-term goals through equity participation.

To ensure a thorough review, we propose extending the due diligence period to 10 weeks and the signing date to 12 weeks from the start of negotiations.

TARGET:
Verde Madera Industries appreciates the proposal from True North Timber Co. and recognizes the strategic alignment between our companies. We are pleased to see the emphasis on sustainability and mutual growth. However, we believe certain aspects of the offer can be further refined to reflect the full value and potential of our company.

**Valuation:**
We propose revising the valuation to $75 million, representing 1.5 times our annual revenue at the higher end of our range. This adjustment accounts for our strong market position, growth potential, and the unique value of our sustainable practices.

**Payment Structure:**
We suggest modifying the payment structure to 80% cash and 20% stock. This change ensures immediate value for our shareholders while maintaining alignment with long-term goals through equity participation.

**Earn-out:**
We recommend expanding the earn-out structure to include specific sustainability metrics alongside EBITDA growth, ensuring our environmental commitments remain central to the agreement.

**Due Diligence and Timeline:**
To ensure a thorough review, we propose extending the due diligence period to 10 weeks and the signing date to 12 weeks from the start of negotiations.

**Key Synergies and Potential Friction:**
We highlight the alignment in sustainability and international market expansion. However, we must safeguard our operational independence in R&D and eco-friendly practices to preserve our core identity.

**Unspoken Interests:**
We emphasize the importance of maintaining our operational independence and sustainability practices, crucial for our continued growth and market presence.

Negotiation History: 
ACQUIRER:
True North Timber Co. is pleased to initiate discussions for the acquisition of Verde Madera Industries. Our proposal reflects a strategic alignment with both companies' commitments to sustainability and growth in the forestry sector.

We propose a valuation of $50 million, representing 1.5 times Verde Madera's annual revenue, recognizing the company's strong position in sustainable wood products. The payment structure will be 70% cash and 30% stock in True North Timber Co., ensuring alignment with our long-term vision.

Key synergies include integrating Verde Madera's innovative eco-friendly practices and expanding our market presence in Brazil. Potential friction points, such as cultural integration, will be addressed through collaborative communication and mutual respect.

We plan an 8-week due diligence period to review operational, financial, and environmental practices. A signing date is proposed for 10 weeks from now, with a 20% earn-out based on EBITDA growth over three years post-acquisition.
