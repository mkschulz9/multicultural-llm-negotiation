We propose the following terms to structure this transaction:\n\n1. **Valuation:**  \n   A\u00e9roTech France S.A. proposes a valuation of $120 million for AgriTech Brasil Sistemas S.A., representing 1.5 times the target's annual revenues at the upper end of its range. This reflects the company's strong R&D focus and growth potential in precision agriculture technologies.\n\n2. **Payment Structure:**  \n   We suggest a combination of cash and stock to optimize the transaction for both parties. Specifically, 70% of the purchase price ($84 million) would be paid in cash at closing, with the remaining 30% ($36 million) paid in A\u00e9roTech France S.A. stock.
